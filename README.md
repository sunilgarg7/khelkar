Repo to contain all my preparation around Technical Interviews and Coding Challenges

I will be trying to put as many comments so that any person looking into this repo can learn from these, I will also try to put what mistakes generatlly people while solving problems. 


Mandatory Note :-)
anybody can write a program that a computer can understand, only good programmers can write code that human can understand.
