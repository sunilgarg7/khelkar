Arrays Tricks and Treats ;-)

if you have Arrays in Question use these things-

1. you can sort Array, if question has multiple Arrays, then sort the ones which have less number of elements 
		and try to solve problem around there. 
	a)  things to remember the 1st element and the last element - 1st will be smallest and last will be largest- offcourse but keep this in mind.
	
2. if you are given an 1 based indexing then you definitely should create a new array with length n +1, otherwise 
		all places you will be dealing with -1 for index {or multiple if conditions} to match with the array position -
				 Use System.arraycopy(arr, 0, newArr, 1, n); [ this is a O(1) operation ] 
		Special case for Range Queries - we will use n+2 array, we still be moving our original array by 1 as described above the next +1 is because
										 for the right side of the queries we have to go +1 every time and to save that checking {if block} whether
										 that is going out of the array length we increment our array by 1.
